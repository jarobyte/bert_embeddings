1061,1,2_abstract_sentence,4,"In this study, by performing classical inhibition experiments using synthetic phosphopeptides and by site-directed mutagenesis of the putative docking site, we have determined that for Grb2 the latter is provided by the tyrosine 620 of Ret/ptc2 long isoform (corresponding to Tyr 1096 on proto-Ret).

1202,1,2_abstract_sentence,0,BACKGROUND: Rare diseases pose many research challenges specific to their scarcity. ,24148153
1202,1,2_abstract_sentence,1,Advances in potential therapies have made it more important than ever to be able to adequately identify not only patients with particular genotypes (via patient registries) but also the medical professionals who provide care for  them at particular specialist centres of expertise and who may be competent to participate in trials. ,24148153
1202,1,2_abstract_sentence,2,Work within the neuromuscular field provides an example of how this may be achieved. ,24148153

2446,0,1_title,0,MARS: improving multiple circular sequence alignment using refined sequences.  ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,0,BACKGROUND: A fundamental assumption of all widely-used multiple sequence alignment techniques is that the left- and right-most positions of the input sequences are relevant to the alignment. ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,1,"However, the position where a sequence starts or ends can be totally arbitrary due to a number of reasons: arbitrariness in the linearisation (sequencing) of a circular molecular structure; or inconsistencies introduced into sequence databases due to different linearisation standards. ",28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,2,"These scenarios are relevant, for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a circular molecular structure. ",28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,3,A solution for these inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred multiple sequence alignment program. ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,4,"RESULTS: We present MARS, a new heuristic method for improving Multiple circular  sequence Alignment using Refined Sequences. ",28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,5,MARS was implemented in the C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences. ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,6,"Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies,  and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. ",28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,7,"Our results show, among others, that the average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA  sequences is reduced by around 5% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence alignment is performed. ",28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,8,CONCLUSIONS: Analysing multiple sequences simultaneously is fundamental in biological research and multiple sequence alignment has been found to be a popular method for this task. ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,9,Conventional alignment techniques cannot be used effectively when the position where sequences start is arbitrary. ,28088189
2446,0,2_abstract_sentence,10,"We present here a method, which can be used in conjunction with any multiple sequence alignment program, to address this problem effectively and efficiently. ",28088189

2025,3,2_abstract_sentence,8,"However, the triad of Ser(999)-phosphorylated EPRS, Ser(77)-phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH forms a functional GAIT complex that inhibits translation of GAIT target mRNAs. ",23071094
