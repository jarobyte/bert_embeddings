An extraction method was developed to recover high-quality RNA from rumen digesta and mouse feces for phylogenetic analysis of metabolically active members of the  gut microbial community. 
Four extraction methods were tested on different amounts of the same samples and compared for efficiency of recovery and purity of RNA. 
Trizol extraction after bead beating produced a higher quantity and quality of RNA than a similar method using phenol/chloroform. 
Dissociation solution produced a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in RNA recovery compared with phosphate-buffered saline during the dissociation of microorganisms from rumen digesta or fecal particles. 
 The identity of metabolically active bacteria in the samples was analyzed by sequencing 87 amplicons produced using bacteria-specific 16S rDNA primers, with cDNA synthesized from the extracted RNA as the template. 
Amplicons representing the major phyla encountered in the rumen (Firmicutes, 43.7%; Proteobacteria, 28.7%; Bacteroidetes, 25.3%; Spirochea, 1.1%, and Synergistes, 1.1%) were recovered, showing that development of the RNA extraction method enables RNA-based analysis of metabolically active bacterial groups from the rumen and other environments. 
Interestingly, in rumen samples, about 30% of the sequenced random 16S rRNA amplicons were related to the Proteobacteria, providing the first evidence that this group may have greater importance in rumen metabolism than previously attributed by DNA-based analysis. 
Techniques for reduction and posterior fixation through the anterior approach.  
Pelvic fractures, especially those of a Malgaigne type, frequently occur in patients who are polytraumatized. 
Sacroiliac disruption reflects a massive, disruptive energy force with concurrent soft tissue injury. 
Fixation through an anterior approach facilitates the accurate and stable fixation and avoids many soft tissue wound problems associated with open anterior approaches. 
The absolute indication for the approach is a posterior disruption of the sacroiliac joint with or without an iliac wing fracture that is unreducible by closed reduction techniques. 
Conservative treatment of Malgaigne fracture in young female--case report.  
INTRODUCTION: Pelvic ring injuries usually result from high-energy trauma, and cranial and abdominal multiple injuries are frequently present. 
Malgaigne fracture is referred to pelvic ring disruption at two sites, and is often treated surgically for its instability. 
We present a case of nonoperative treatment of Malgaigne pelvic fracture. 
CASE OUTLINE: A 17-year-old girl sustained a Malgaigne fracture falling off a horse. 
After ruling out urgent multiple trauma in local hospital, she was then transferred to Pediatric Orthopedic and Trauma Service at the Institute of Orthopedic Surgery "Banjica" Belgrade, with provisional cutaneous traction of 2 kg applied to her right leg. 
After the status evaluation, the supracondylar femoral traction was applied for three months, combined with pelvic cradle for first 73 days. 
Weight of traction was gradually adjusted according to x-ray check-up, ranging from 1-16 kg (1/4 of body weight). 
Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered for 10 days, and thromboprophylaxis for two months. 
After the removal of traction, physical therapy was applied and the patient achieved full weight bearing four months after the injury. 
Treatment outcome was a symmetric and stable pelvic ring, equal leg length, full range of motion in both hip joints and normal walking. 
CONCLUSION: Traction therapy, combined with gravitational suspension in pelvic cradle, resulted in excellent clinical result. 
Although significantly longer and  more loaded than usual, normal weight bearing and walking were promptly achieved  using intensive physical therapy. 
External fixation of unstable Malgaigne fractures: the comparative mechanical performance of a new configuration.  
An external fixator has been designed that is rigid enough to eliminate the need  for skeletal traction in patients with unstable pelvic-ring fractures. 
This Wichita frame is similar to the Pittsburgh frame but is stiffened by the use of locked crossbars connecting the side triangles. 
The frame was tested in cadaveric specimens by techniques previously reported. 
In addition, finite-element modeling of the various frame designs was performed to ensure that the frame configuration was optimal and to supplement in vitro test results. 
Multiple variables that can  influence frame failure loads were examined. 
Pathologic Malgaigne fracture following pelvic irradiation. A case report.  
Chiropractic care of a patient with low back pain associated with subluxations and a Malgaigne-type pelvic fracture.  
OBJECTIVE: To describe the chiropractic care of a patient with a pelvic ring fracture and concomitant subluxations of multiple segments of the spinal column. 
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 23-year-old male, after falling down a flight of stairs, was initially hospitalized for fractures of the pelvis. 
Five weeks posthospitalization, the patient initiated chiropractic care with complaints of severe low back pain with lower extremity involvement. 
He also complained of neck pain and occipital headache. 
The patient had several positive low back orthopedic tests with bilaterally absent Achilles deep tendon reflexes. 
The anteroposterior  radiographic view revealed ununited fractures at the left superior and inferior pubic ramus, noted as a type I Malgaigne fracture. 
Subluxations were detected at  the left innominate (ie, fracture-subluxation) and at the patient's lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. 
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was cared for with contact-specific, high-velocity, low-amplitude adjustments to sites of vertebral and sacroiliac subluxations. 
The patient's response to care was positive, receiving great pain relief. 
Less than 3 months after initiating care, the patient returned to work on regular duty. 
CONCLUSION: There are indications that patients suffering from the injuries described above may derive benefits from chiropractic care. 
The practitioner must pay careful attention to issues of biomechanical and vascular stability and adjustment modifications in these types of patients. 
Pelvic fracture and associated urologic injuries.  
Successful management of patients with major pelvic injuries requires a team approach including orthopedic, urologic, and trauma surgeons. 
Each unstable pelvic disruption must be treated aggressively to minimize complications and maximize long-term functional outcome. 
Commonly associated urologic injuries include injuries of the urethra, corpora cavernosa (penis), bladder, and bladder  neck. 
Bladder injuries are usually extraperitoneal and result from shearing forces or direct laceration by a bone spicule. 
Posterior urethral injuries occur  more commonly with vertically applied forces, which typically create Malgaigne-type fractures. 
Common complications of urethral disruption are urethral stricture, incontinence, and impotence. 
Acute urethral injury management is controversial, although it appears that early primary realignment has promise  for minimizing the complications. 
Impotence after pelvic fracture is predominantly vascular in origin, not neurologic as once thought. 
Open reduction and internal fixation of an acetabular fracture during pregnancy.  
Fractures of the pelvis and acetabulum are common injuries in a mechanized society and frequently occur in the younger age groups. 
Commonly associated injuries such as hemorrhage, urethral tears, gastrointestinal injuries, and major vessel damage are well reported and well known to orthopaedic surgeons. 
Another less frequently reported complication of pelvic fractures is the potential association with pregnancy and subsequent childbirth. 
This problem was first described by Malgaigne in 1857 in his classic article on double vertical fractures of the pelvis, in which he described a 34-year-old woman with a pelvic  fracture who subsequently died during childbirth. 
A review of the literature reveals numerous articles addressing potential problems with parturition subsequent to a pelvic fracture and several articles dealing with pelvic fractures occurring during pregnancy. 
The current literature on pelvic fractures  during pregnancy, however, recommends only nonoperative treatment and, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of operative fixation during pregnancy. 
The purpose of this article is to report a case of an acetabular fracture in a pregnant woman treated with open reduction and internal fixation, who went on to  carry a full-term baby and have a normal delivery. 
Fractures of the sacrum and disk herniation: rare lesions in the pediatric surgical patient?  
Fractures of the sacrum and lesions of the intervertebral disks are seldom reported in childhood and adolescence. 
In our report, illustrated by three representative cases that we treated during the past six months, we show that sacrum fractures, not an easy diagnosis, may be more frequent than currently assumed, and that in quite a number of children and adolescents an anterior pelvic fracture may in fact be an unrecognized Malgaigne type pelvic fracture with a posterior fracture plane cutting through the sacrum. 
They may be accompanied by herniations and/or lacerations of intervertebral disks. 
CT detection of serious internal and skeletal injuries in patients with pelvic fractures.  
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of patients with known pelvic fractures who have additional findings of intraabdominal injury, as diagnosed at abdominal computed tomography (CT), and to determine if patients with specific types or patterns of fractures are more likely to have additional injuries. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 200 consecutive patients (125 women, 75 men; age range, 4-86 years) who had been admitted to a level 1 trauma center with osseous pelvic injury secondary to blunt trauma and who had undergone abdominal CT examinations. 
Abdominal CT findings in  these patients were classified as negative, positive, or minimal and correlated with mechanism of pelvic fracture. 
RESULTS: Sixty-five (32%) of the 200 patients had negative CT findings, 43 (22%)  had findings attributable to the trauma but required no follow-up, and 92 (46%) had positive findings that required nonsurgical management or exploratory laparotomy. 
Additional pelvic fractures were identified in 63 (32%) patients. 
The highest prevalence of additional injuries was in patients with Malgaigne fractures (four of 15, 27%) or bilateral pubic rami fractures (six of 18, 33%). 
CONCLUSION: CT examinations revealed that 135 (68%) of 200 patients with pelvic fractures secondary to blunt trauma had concomitant internal or skeletal injuries and that 92 (46%) patients had injuries severe enough to require nonsurgical management or exploratory laparotomy. 
Patients with bilateral pubic rami fractures or Malgaigne fractures were particularly prone to additional injuries;  therefore, abdominal CT examinations are recommended in these patients. 
Symptomatic enterothorax in right-sided dorsal rupture of the diaphragm.  
Traumatic avulsion of the right diaphragm from the lumbocostal arch is a very rare lesion. 
The authours report the case of a 27-year-old man who had suffered a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the right side, 10 years before. 
At the time of injury the lesion of the diaphragm went unnoticed. 
The diagnosis was made 10 years later when the patient was referred for chronic right thoracic pain combined with postprandial abdominal distension and crampy pain in the abdomen. 
The chest radiogram and CT-scan showed displacement of the right kidney and most of the right colon into the thorax due  to avulsion of the diaphragm from its dorsal insertion on the lumbocostal arch. 
Surgical repair was necessary to obtain relief from pain and to prevent intestinal obstruction. 
Reduction of the hernia, reinsertion of the diaphragm to  the lumbocostal arch and reinforcement of the repair with a prolene mesh prosthesis was performed through a right thoracophrenolumbotomy incision. 
Malgaigne pelvic ring injury in childhood.  
Pelvic girdle injuries leading to anterior and posterior disruption are rarely seen in children. 
External fixation is useful to reduce and stabilize the pelvis  in order to control massive blood loss due to severe venous bleeding. 
The anterior tension band element of the external fixator can successfully maintain reduction of the pelvic girdle. 
Dislocation or fracture dislocation of the sacroiliacal joint cannot be reduced with simple traction techniques. 
Leg length  discrepancy is to be expected when the hemipelvis is displaced. 
Seven cases of this rare injury in children are presented together with the late outcome. 
Treatment modalities are discussed. 
Avulsion Fracture and Myositis Ossificans in a Professional Teenage Dancer: A Case Report.  
Fractures of the transverse processes in the lumbar vertebrae occur as the result of major forces such as direct blunt trauma, violent lateral flexion-extension forces, avulsion of the psoas muscle, or Malgaigne fractures of the pelvis. 
Dancers make repeated and forceful hyperextension and flexions of the spine, which may cause fractures of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. 
Repeated trauma of muscles in dancers may cause avulsion fractures and myositis ossificans. 
Herein, we report MRI and CT findings of an avulsion from the right transverse process of the L2 and L3 vertebrae in a 16-year-old professional teenage dancer, who responded to conservative treatment. 
Stabilization of sacroiliac joint disruption with threaded compression rods.  
Eleven cases of sacroiliac dislocation and/or fracture (Malgaigne pattern) were successfully reduced and stabilized using two threaded compression rods. 
The mean follow-up period was 26.1 months (range, seven to 45 months). 
None of the implants failed and there was no subsequent displacement. 
Two patients had mild residual lower back pain, and one was treated with implant removal without subsequent relief of pain. 
One patient, in whom the operation was done 110 days after dislocation, had extension of an incomplete preoperative peroneal nerve palsy. 
After anterior pelvic ring stabilization has been performed, two threaded  3/16-inch diameter rods are driven from the normal posterior iliac wing superficial to the sacrum and through the reduced opposite iliac wing. 
Compression is obtained with washers and nuts. 
This procedure can be performed safely and effectively, providing stable fixation and allowing early mobilization to help lessen or prevent the complications associated with prolonged bed rest. 
Abdominal trauma associated with pelvic fracture.  
Comparative study of the Orthofix and Pittsburgh frames for external fixation of  unstable pelvic ring fractures.  
We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver  pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) fracture/dislocations. 
The pelves were quasi-statically loaded in longitudinal compression and loss of reduction (i.e., failure) was defined as 1.5 cm of diastasis at either of the fracture/dislocation sites. 
The Orthofix frame-pelvis  complex (four 6-mm half-pins) was comparable to the PTF-pelvis complex (eight 5-mm half-pins) in terms of load to failure and overall stiffness, but was 4-7 times stiffer at lower load levels. 
Both frame-and-pin complexes deformed moderately at the pin-bone interface, but, while the PTF also showed moderate displacement between frame components, the Orthofix had almost no frame intercomponent motion. 
Malgaigne's fracture: the Larrey variant--a case report.  
A rare Malgaigne fracture with caudal displacement of the acetabular section is presented. 
This variant has not received significant mention in existing literature. 
It is important because it changes the approach to initial stabilization. 
Treatment is best accomplished with ORIF and placement of a sacral bar. 
Significant complications would occur if this variant were mistaken and treated with traction. 
Surgical treatment of a Malgaigne fracture.  
Sacral fractures are generally accompanied by pelvic ring fractures. 
They rarely  develop in an isolated form. 
Sacroiliac dislocation without sacral fracture is extremely rare. 
We report a case with a sacroiliac dislocation without sacral fracture, which was treated surgically. 
Lumbopelvic stabilization was applied using iliac wing plates. 
The case was evaluated according to his clinical condition and visual analogue score (VAS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and Oswestry scales. 
Considering the role of the sacrum, which transmits the load of the entire spine to the pelvis, meticulous care must be given to ensure the mechanic stability of the spine when evaluating patients with sacral and pelvic fractures. 
Very serious spinopelvic instability is present in sacroiliac dislocations even in the absence of sacral fractures. 
Caudal migration of the sacrum together with the cranial migration of the iliac wings can cause serious pelvic imbalance and difficulties in walking and maintaining a standing position. 
Aggressive stabilization and fusion are required, and these must be performed in the early period. 
Posterior stabilization of pelvic fractures by use of threaded compression rods.  Case reports and mechanical testing.  
Unstable pelvic fracture with concomitant displacement of the uterus--case report.  
The paper deals with the displacement of the uterus observed during management of Malgaigne type pelvic fracture in a 33 years old female. 
An intrauterine device seen on the radiographs revealed displacement of the uterus towards contralateral side of the pelvis. 
The reduction of the fracture stabilized with Molski metal clamp reconstituted normal anatomy. 
Two compression rods to treat unstable lesions of the pelvic ring.  
The authors report 7 cases involving the surgical treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures (Malgaigne type) using two compression bars, as described by Tile. 
The method was used only in cases where x-ray examination and CT scan revealed that the posterior branch of the fracture was located at the very medial aspect of the sacrum (fracture through the sacral foramina or even medial to the sacral  foramina), and therefore could not be stabilized by using other devices. 
The pathological anatomy of Malgaigne fracture-dislocations of the pelvis.  
Caralluma Fimbriata Supplementation Improves the Appetite Behavior of Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome.  
BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from a deletion of the paternal genes in the region of chromosome 15q11-q13. 
PWS develops hyperphagia, which when left unmanaged, leads to an excessive ingestion of food. 
To date there is inadequate pharmacological treatment or supplementation for modification of the PWS hyperphagia and/or the associated behaviors. 
Therefore, the best practice is  familial supervision and restriction of diet and environment. 
AIM: We aimed to determine if the natural supplement of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) could attenuate hyperphagia or the associated appetite behaviors in children and adolescents with PWS over the 4-week pilot trial period. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial over a 10-week period to investigate the effects of CFE on hunger control, in a cohort of children and adolescents with confirmed PWS (n =15, mean age 9.27 ± 3.16 years, body weight 43.98 ± 23.99 kg). 
Participants from Australia and New Zealand ingested CFE or a placebo of maltodextrin/cabbage  leaf over a 4-week period, with a 2-week washout before the crossover to the other treatment. 
Weekly comparisons in appetite behavior, severity, and drive were recorded by parents, as scaled time-point measures on a hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS. 
RESULTS: CFE administration was found to induce a significant accumulative easing of hyperphagia (P = 0.05), with decreases evident in one-third of the participants. 
Furthermore due to CFE supplementation, a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) was recorded in the category of behavior and a decrease in hyperphagia (n = 8, P = 0.009) was observed at the highest dose 1,000 mg/day (recommended adult dose). 
There were no reported adverse effects at any dose. 
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that an extract of the Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata eases hyperphagic appetite behavior within a cohort of children and adolescents (n = 15) with PWS without notable adverse effects. 
The outcomes of this study will have a potential positive impact on PWS management. 
Localization of the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta 3 subunit to the Angelman/Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15.  
Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). 
The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. 
However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. 
This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). 
No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. 
We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. 
Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. 
Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. 
The localization of this receptor  gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes. 
Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes share a common chromosome 15 deletion but differ in parental origin of the deletion.  
Many Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) patients have a cytogenetic deletion of 15q11q13. 
While AS and PWS share a similar cytogenetic anomaly, they have very different clinical phenotypes. 
DNAs from 4 AS patients were examined using 5 chromosome 15q11q13-specific cloned DNA segments. 
With the  present level of resolution, the molecular deletions between AS and those previously reported for PWS did not appear to differ. 
However, in contrast to the paternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 observed in the majority of PWS patients, maternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 was demonstrated in the AS patients by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). 
Chromosome 15 uniparental disomy is not frequent in Angelman syndrome.  
Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). 
This hypothesis is derived from two lines of evidence. 
First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of  chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate  from different parental chromosomes. 
In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15. 
The second line of evidence comes from the deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. 
These patients have two maternal copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of one copy from each parent. 
By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 specific  DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. 
Inheritance of one maternal copy and one paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS phenotype in these patients. 
Maternal origin of 15q11-13 deletions in Angelman syndrome suggests a role for genomic imprinting.

Experimental approaches for investigation of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase phosphorylation.  
Phosphorylation of many aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs) has been recognized for decades, but the contribution of post-translational modification to their primary role in tRNA charging and decryption of genetic code remains unclear. 
In  contrast, phosphorylation is essential for performance of diverse noncanonical functions of AARSs unrelated to protein synthesis. 
Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) has been investigated extensively in our laboratory for more than a decade, and has served as an archetype for studies of  other AARSs. 
EPRS is a constituent of the IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that directs transcript-selective translational control in myeloid cells. 
Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of EPRS is essential for its release from the parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MSC),  for binding to other GAIT complex proteins, and for regulating the binding to target mRNAs. 
Importantly, phosphorylation is the common driving force for the context- and stimulus-dependent release, and non-canonical activity, of other AARSs residing in the MSC, for example, lysyl tRNA synthetase (KARS). 
Here, we describe the concepts and experimental methodologies we have used to investigate  the influence of phosphorylation on the structure and function of EPRS. 
We suggest that application of these approaches will help to identify new functional phosphorylation event(s) in other AARSs and elucidate their possible roles in noncanonical activities. 
Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 dictates transcript-selective translational control.  
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical but essential member of the Cdk kinase family, and its dysregulation or deletion has been implicated in inflammation-related disorders by an undefined mechanism. 
Here we show that Cdk5  is an indispensable activator of the GAIT (IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a posttranscriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells. 
Through induction of its regulatory protein, Cdk5R1 (p35), IFN-γ activates Cdk5 to phosphorylate Ser(886)  in the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. 
Cdk5/p35 also induces, albeit indirectly via a distinct kinase, phosphorylation of Ser(999), the second essential event in GAIT  pathway activation. 
Diphosphorylated EPRS is released from its residence in the tRNA multisynthetase complex for immediate binding to NS1-associated protein and  subsequent binding to ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH. 
The mature heterotetrameric GAIT complex binds the 3' UTR GAIT element of VEGF-A and other target mRNAs and suppresses their translation in myeloid cells. 
Inhibition of Cdk5/p35 inhibits both EPRS phosphorylation events, prevents EPRS release from the tRNA multisynthetase complex, and blocks translational suppression of GAIT element-bearing mRNAs, resulting in increased expression of inflammatory proteins. 
Our study reveals a unique role of Cdk5/p35 in activation of the major  noncanonical function of EPRS, namely translational control of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. 
Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity.  
Glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) is a component of the heterotetrameric gamma-interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that binds 3'UTR GAIT elements in multiple interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible mRNAs and  suppresses their translation. 
Here, we elucidate the specific EPRS phosphorylation events that regulate GAIT-mediated gene silencing. 
IFN-gamma induces sequential phosphorylation of Ser(886) and Ser(999) in the noncatalytic linker connecting the synthetase cores. 
Phosphorylation of both sites is essential for EPRS release from the parent tRNA multisynthetase complex. 
Ser(886) phosphorylation is required for the interaction of NSAP1, which blocks EPRS binding to target mRNAs. 
The same phosphorylation event induces subsequent binding of ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH and restores mRNA binding. 
Finally, Ser(999) phosphorylation directs the formation of a functional GAIT complex that  binds initiation factor eIF4G and represses translation. 
Thus, two-site phosphorylation provides structural and functional pliability to EPRS and choreographs the repertoire of activities that regulates inflammatory gene expression. 
Heterotrimeric GAIT complex drives transcript-selective translation inhibition in murine macrophages.  
The gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex in human myeloid cells is heterotetrameric, consisting of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 
The complex binds a structural  GAIT element in the 3' untranslated region of VEGF-A and other inflammation-related transcripts and inhibits their translation. 
EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999); L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK. 
Because profound differences in inflammatory responses between mice and humans are known, we investigated the GAIT system in mouse macrophages. 
The murine GAIT complex is heterotrimeric, lacking NSAP1. 
As in humans, IFN-γ activates the mouse macrophage GAIT system via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a. 
Murine L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade, but EPRS is phosphorylated only at Ser(999). 
Loss of EPRS Ser(886) phosphorylation prevents NSAP1 incorporation into the GAIT  complex. 
However, the triad of Ser(999)-phosphorylated EPRS, Ser(77)-phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH forms a functional GAIT complex that inhibits translation of GAIT target mRNAs. 
Thus, translational control by the heterotrimeric GAIT complex in mice exemplifies the distinctive species-specific  responses of myeloid cells to inflammatory stimuli.
