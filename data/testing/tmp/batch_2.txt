At both weeks 10 and 28, romosozumab significantly decreased eroded surface (ES/BS). 
At week 28, romosozumab also significantly reduced resorption period (Rs.P) and final resorption depth (Rs.De). 
The reduced final Rs.De combined with the increased W.Th resulted in a significant increase in bone balance (BB) at the level of the remodeling unit. 
Assessment of bone formation on the vertebral periosteal and endocortical surfaces following 28weeks of treatment revealed that romosozumab significantly increased bone formation on these surfaces, which had attenuated by week 28, resulting in significant increases in new periosteal and endocortical bone by week 28. 
These data suggest that multiple factors potentially contribute to the increase in spine BMD with romosozumab treatment. 
In the early period of treatment, increased modeling-based bone formation, increased W.Th at remodeling  sites, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to decreased ES/BS in vertebral cancellous bone, and increased periosteal and endocortical bone formation in the  vertebral cortex contribute to the early increase in spine BMD. 
Following the self-regulation of bone formation when modeling-based bone formation has attenuated, a decrease in remodeling space secondary to reduced ES/BS and a positive BB secondary to decreased final Rs.De and increased W.Th contribute to the progressive increase in spine BMD with long-term treatment. 
Romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis.  
INTRODUCTION: Sclerostin, a glycoprotein produced primarily by osteocytes, blocks the canonical Wnt signaling bone formation pathway. 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin that binds to sclerostin, permitting the engagement of Wnt ligands with their co-receptors, resulting in an increase in bone formation and bone mineral density (BMD). 
Clinical studies with romosozumab  have shown dramatic improvements in BMD at the spine and hip. 
Romosozumab is associated with improvement in bone strength through mechanisms that include increases in bone formation and, different from classical osteoanabolic agents, suppression of bone resorption. 
Areas covered: Herein, the authors highlight the  available data on romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis. 
This includes the latest data on the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as safety and tolerability data. 
Expert opinion: Monthly subcutaneous dosing of romosozumab reduces the risk of vertebral and clinical fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, with a favorable balance of benefits and risks. 
Romosozumab is a promising emerging anabolic agent with a novel mechanism of action that may expand the options for treating osteoporotic patients at high risk of fracture. 
Romosozumab Treatment Converts Trabecular Rods into Trabecular Plates in Male Cynomolgus Monkeys.  
Treatment with sclerostin antibody (romosozumab) increases bone formation while reducing bone resorption, leading to increases in bone volume and bone mineral density. 
Sclerostin antibody treatment may also provide beneficial changes in trabecular microarchitecture and strength that are not reflected in bone volume and density. 
Here we use three-dimensional dynamic histomorphometry to determine  longitudinal changes in vertebral trabecular microarchitecture in adolescent male cynomolgus monkeys (4-5 years old) treated with sclerostin antibody. 
Animals were treated bi-weekly with either sclerostin antibody (30 mg/kg, sc, n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) for 10 weeks. 
Animals were administered fluorochrome bone formation labels on days 14 and 24 (tetracycline) and on days 56 and 66 (calcein), followed by necropsy on day 70. 
Cylindrical specimens of cancellous bone from the 5th lumbar vertebrae were used to generate high-resolution, three-dimensional images of bone and fluorescent labels of bone formation (0.7 × 0.7 × 5.0 µm/voxel). 
The three-dimensional images of the bone formation labels were used to determine the bone volume formed between days 14 and 66 and the resulting alterations in trabecular microarchitecture within each bone. 
Treatment with sclerostin antibody resulted in a conversion of rod-like trabeculae into plate-like trabeculae at a higher rate than in vehicle-treated animals (p = 0.01). 
Plate bone volume fraction was greater in the sclerostin antibody group relative to vehicle (mean 43 vs. 
30%, p < 0.05). 
Bone formation increased the thickness of trabeculae in all three trabecular orientations (axial, oblique, and transverse, p < 0.05). 
The volume of bone formed between days 14 to 66 was greater in sclerostin antibody-treated groups (9.0 vs. 
5.4%, p = 0.02), and new bone formation due to sclerostin antibody treatment was associated with increased apparent stiffness as determined from finite element models. 
Our results demonstrate that increased bone formation associated with sclerostin antibody treatment increases plate-like trabecular morphology and improves mechanical performance. 
Carcinogenicity risk assessment of romosozumab: A review of scientific weight-of-evidence and findings in a rat lifetime pharmacology study.  
Romosozumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds and blocks the action of sclerostin, a protein secreted by the osteocyte and an extracellular inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. 
Blockade of sclerostin binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5 and LRP6) allows Wnt ligands to activate canonical Wnt signaling in bone, increasing  bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, making sclerostin an attractive target for osteoporosis therapy. 
Because romosozumab is a bone-forming agent and  an activator of canonical Wnt signaling, questions have arisen regarding a potential carcinogenic risk. 
Weight-of-evidence factors used in the assessment of human carcinogenic risk of romosozumab included features of canonical Wnt signaling, expression pattern of sclerostin, phenotype of loss-of-function mutations in humans and mice, mode and mechanism of action of romosozumab, and findings from romosozumab chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
Although  the weight-of-evidence factors supported that romosozumab would pose a low carcinogenic risk to humans, the carcinogenic potential of romosozumab was assessed in a rat lifetime study. 
There were no romosozumab-related effects on tumor incidence in rats. 
The findings of the lifetime study and the weight-of-evidence factors collectively indicate that romosozumab administration  would not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. 
Novel therapies for osteoporosis.  
Since the identification of osteoporosis as a major health issue in aging populations and the subsequent development of the first treatment modalities for  its management, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling bone turnover and disease pathophysiology, thus enabling the pinpointing of new targets for intervention. 
This progress, along with advances in biotechnology, has rendered possible the development of ever more sophisticated treatments employing novel mechanisms of action. 
Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, approved for the treatment of postmenopausal and male osteoporosis, significantly and continuously increases bone mineral density (BMD) and maintains a low risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures for up to 8 years. 
Currently available combinations of estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators moderately increase BMD without causing the extra-skeletal adverse effects of each compound alone. 
The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has recently been shown to decrease vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fracture rates and is nearing approval. 
Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at  present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. 
Several other agents are currently in earlier clinical and preclinical phases of development, including dickkopf-1 antagonists, activin A antagonists, β-arrestin analogs, calcilytics, and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Effects of Romosozumab Compared With Teriparatide on Bone Density and Mass at the Spine and Hip in Postmenopausal Women With Low Bone Mass.  
Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds sclerostin, has a dual effect on bone by increasing bone formation and reducing bone resorption, and thus has favorable effects in both aspects of bone volume regulation. 
In a phase 2 study,  romosozumab increased areal BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip as measured by  DXA compared with placebo, alendronate, and teriparatide in postmenopausal women  with low bone mass. 
In additional analyses from this international, randomized study, we now describe the effect of romosozumab on lumbar spine and hip volumetric BMD (vBMD) and BMC at month 12 as assessed by QCT in the subset of participants receiving placebo, s.c. 
teriparatide (20 µg once daily), and s.c. 
romosozumab (210 mg once monthly). 
QCT measurements were performed at the lumbar  spine (mean of L1 and L2 entire vertebral bodies, excluding posterior processes)  and hip. 
One year of treatment with romosozumab significantly increased integral  vBMD and BMC at the lumbar spine and total hip from baseline, and compared with placebo and teriparatide (all p < 0.05). 
Trabecular vertebral vBMD improved significantly and similarly from baseline (p < 0.05) with both romosozumab (18.3%) and teriparatide (20.1%), whereas cortical vertebral vBMD gains were larger with romosozumab compared with teriparatide (13.7% versus 5.7%, p < 0.0001). 
Trabecular hip vBMD gains were significantly larger with romosozumab than with teriparatide (10.8% versus 4.2%, p = 0.01), but were similar for cortical vBMD (1.1% versus -0.9%, p = 0.12). 
Cortical BMC gains were larger with  romosozumab compared with teriparatide at both the spine (23.3% versus 10.9%, p < 0.0001) and hip (3.4% versus 0.0%, p = 0.03). 
These improvements are expected to result in strength gains and support the continued clinical investigation of romosozumab as a potential therapy to rapidly reduce fracture risk in ongoing phase 3 studies.

Recent advances in the management of osteoporosis.  
There has been substantial progress in the management of patients with osteoporosis and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. 
Currently available strong anti-resorptive agents are bisphosphonates and an anti-receptor activator  of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) antibody, denosumab. 
Although bisphosphonates and denosumab both inhibit bone resorption and prevent vertebral  and non-vertebral fractures, their mechanisms of action are different. 
Whereas bisphosphonates' effects on bone mineral density and fracture peak around 3 to 5  years and become plateaued, those of denosumab are maintained for up to 10 years. 
There are differences in the modes of action of these two drugs. 
Bisphosphonates  accumulate on the mineralized bone surface and are released by the acid environment under osteoclastic bone resorption, whereas denosumab is not accumulated on bone but directly binds RANKL and inhibits its binding to the receptor RANK. 
Thus, the reduction in denosumab concentration 4 to 6 months after injection may enable RANK to bind to RANKL, where it is highly expressed, such as in damaged bone regions. 
As anabolic agents, only teriparatide has been available for a long time, but abaloparatide, a synthetic analog of PTHrP(1-34), is currently under development. 
Because of the difference in the preferential binding conformations of PTH1 receptor between teriparatide and abaloparatide, the latter shows anabolic effects with fewer bone resorptive effects. 
Romosozumab, an anti-sclerostin antibody, inhibits the action of sclerostin, a canonical Wnt signal inhibitor secreted from osteocytes, and enhances canonical Wnt signaling. 
Romosozumab robustly increases vertebral and proximal femoral bone mineral density within 12 months and inhibits vertebral and clinical fractures in patients with osteoporosis by enhancing bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption. 
In this review, we summarize the recent advances in therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis and discuss future prospects with their  use. 
Romosozumab: from basic to clinical aspects.  
The Wnt pathway has an important role in bone formation. 
Inactivation of sclerostin, an inhibitor of this pathway, has been associated with increased bone mass both in animal experiments and in human clinical trials. 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin. 
Preclinical studies showed that this antibody primarily increases bone formation resulting in increased bone mineral density. 
Initial studies carried out in humans are in line with data obtained in animals. 
If these results are confirmed in larger studies with fracture end-points, this monoclonal antibody with its anabolic action, will become a key drug in the treatment of osteoporosis. 
Profile of romosozumab and its potential in the management of osteoporosis.  
Increased understanding of bone biology has led to the discovery of several unique signaling pathways that regulate bone formation and resorption. 
The Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role in skeletal development, adult skeletal homeostasis, and bone remodeling. 
Sclerostin is an inhibitor of the Wnt  signaling pathway. 
Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to sclerostin, prevents sclerostin from exerting this inhibitory effect. 
Therefore,  in the presence of romosozumab, the Wnt signaling pathway is activated leading to bone formation and bone mineral density gain. 
Clinical studies of romosozumab have shown that this agent is one of the most potent bone anabolic agents in development to date. 
Romosozumab does not act solely as an anabolic agent, but rather, it has effects on increasing bone formation as well as reducing bone resorption. 
In the clinical studies, patients tolerated romosozumab well with no  major safety signals reported. 
In a Phase III study, romosozumab as compared to placebo has been shown to reduce vertebral fractures by 73% after 1 year of treatment. 
Sequential therapy with romosozumab for 1 year followed by denosumab in the second year reduced vertebral fractures by 75% as compared to the group that received placebo for 1 year and denosumab in the second year. 
Romosozumab holds significant potential, by a novel mechanism of action, to expand our ability to treat osteoporosis. 
More studies are needed to determine the ideal setting in which romosozumab may be used to optimize osteoporosis treatment. 
Connecting the Dots: Linking Osteocyte Activity and Therapeutic Modulation of Sclerostin by Extending a Multiscale Systems Model.  
The goal of this work was to extend a mathematical, multiscale systems model of bone function, remodeling, and health in order to explore hypotheses related to therapeutic modulation of sclerostin and quantitatively describe purported osteocyte activity within bone remodeling events. 
A pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and dual elimination pathways was used to describe the kinetics of romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against sclerostin. 
To describe total circulating sclerostin, an extended indirect response model of inhibition of offset was developed. 
These models were subsequently linked to the  systems model, with sclerostin signaling changes in resorption and formation through established osteocyte-mediated mechanisms. 
The model proposes relative contributions of the osteocyte to the RANKL pool, a major player in feedback signaling, and is used to explore hypotheses surrounding attenuation of anabolic  activity after multiple doses of sclerostin mAbs, a phenomenon whose mechanism is poorly understood. 
Hepatoprotection by L-Ornithine L-Aspartate in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.  
BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading chronic hepatic condition worldwide and new approaches to management and treatment are limited. 
SUMMARY: L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) has hepatoprotective properties in patients with fatty liver of diverse etiology and results of a multicenter randomized clinical trial reveal that 12 weeks treatment with oral LOLA (6-9 g/d) results in a dose-related reduction in activities of liver enzymes and triglycerides together with significant improvements of liver/spleen CT ratios. 
A preliminary report described improvements of hepatic microcirculation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) following treatment with LOLA. 
Mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of LOLA in NAFLD/NASH involve,  in addition to its established ammonia-lowering effect, metabolic transformations of the LOLA-constituent amino acids L-ornithine and L-aspartate into L-glutamine, L-arginine, and glutathione. 
These metabolites have well-established actions implicated in the prevention of lipid peroxidation, improvement of hepatic microcirculation in addition to anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. 
Key Messages: (1) LOLA is effective for the treatment of key indices in NAFLD/NASH. 
(2) Mechanisms other than LOLA's ammonia-lowering action have been postulated. 
(3) Further assessments in the clinical setting are now required. 
Pharmacotherapy for NASH: Current and emerging.

Cenicriviroc for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis.  
INTRODUCTION: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has an increasing prevalence worldwide. 
At present, no specific pharmacotherapy is approved for NAFLD. 
Simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to liver fibrosis that is associated with mortality in NAFLD. 
The recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages via chemokine receptor CCR2 as well as of  lymphocytes and hepatic stellate cells via CCR5 promote the progression of NASH to fibrosis. 
Areas covered: I summarize preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy and safety of the dual CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc (CVC, also TBR-652 or TAK-652) for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis. 
In animal models of liver diseases, CVC potently inhibits macrophage accumulation in the liver and ameliorates fibrosis. 
In a phase 2b clinical trial (CENTAUR) on 289 patients with NASH and fibrosis, CVC consistently demonstrated liver fibrosis improvement after 1 year of therapy and had an excellent safety profile, leading to the implementation of a phase 3 trial (AURORA). 
Expert opinion: Preclinical and clinical data support the development of CVC as a safe and potent antifibrotic agent. 
However, open questions around CVC are the durability of antifibrotic responses, divergent effects on NASH versus fibrosis, potential long-term concerns and the expected path to approval. 
Current and future pharmacological therapies for NAFLD/NASH.  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and there is no approved pharmacotherapy. 
The efficacy of vitamin E and pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD. 
GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. 
Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. 
The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. 
Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues. 
A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. 
This class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). 
A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. 
Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). 
The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. 
Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist. 
Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH. 
Within the next few years, the availability of therapeutic options for NASH will hopefully curb the rising trend of NASH-related diseases. 
Skin ultrastructural findings in type 2 Gaucher disease: diagnostic implications.  
BACKGROUND: Type 2 Gaucher disease is a rare and progressive subtype of this lysosomal storage disorder, marked by rapid, early-onset neurodegeneration. 
Distinguishing type 2 from types 1 and 3 Gaucher disease has remained challenging, due to the lack of a clear correlation between phenotype and enzymatic activity or genotype. 
β-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, also has an essential role in maintaining epidermal permeability function, by regulating the ratio of ceramides to glucosylceramides in the stratum corneum of the skin. 
OBJECTIVES: To further assess the diagnostic utility of epidermal evaluations in  distinguishing patients with type 2 Gaucher disease in an expanded cohort. 
STUDY DESIGN: Epidermal samples were evaluated from twenty children with type 2,  three patients with type 3 Gaucher disease and two adults with type 1 Gaucher disease with different clinical manifestations and genotypes. 
Electron microscopy on ruthenium tetroxide post-fixed tissue was performed. 
RESULTS: Compared to controls and subjects with type 1 and type 3 Gaucher disease, only patients with type 2 Gaucher disease displayed characteristic electron dense, non-lamellar clefts and immature-lamellar membranes. 
CONCLUSION: The appearance of characteristic alterations in epidermal ultrastructure provides an early and specific diagnostic tool to help in distinguishing type 2 from the other types of Gaucher disease. 
Gaucher disease with prenatal onset and perinatal death due to compound heterozygosity for the missense R131C and null Rec Nci I GBA mutations.  
Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA, E.C.3.2.1.45). 
Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1, nonneuronopathic;  type 2, acute neuronopathic; and type 3, subacute neuronopathic (OMIM 230800, 230900, 231000). 
Over the past decade, recognition of a distinct, perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease (PLGD) has led researchers and clinicians to evaluate Gaucher disease in the differential diagnosis of congenital ichthyosis and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. 
To date, more than 30 cases of PLGD have been genotyped and reported. 
It has been observed that homozygosity for recombinant GBA alleles, which are fundamentally null alleles, leads to early lethality, usually in utero or during the 1st few days of life, whereas genotypes involving  a recombinant allele and a missense mutation may be less detrimental. 
Here, we report a case of Gaucher disease with prenatal onset and death within hours of birth, likely due to compound heterozygosity for the GBA Rec Nci I null allele and a R131C missense mutation. 
In view of the patient's severe clinical course, and based on reviews of other PLGD cases, we postulate that a missense mutation that abruptly disrupts the structure/function of GBA, in combination with a null  allele, may result in early lethality in patients with PLGD. 
We also speculate that R131C is an extremely severe mutation that has occurred more than once in different populations and, in either the homozygous form or heterozygous with another severe mutation, will result in a poor prognosis. 
Gaucher disease.  
Although Gaucher disease is a rare disorder, recent developments in novel means for therapeutic intervention have invigorated both academic research and pharmaceutical industry discovery programmes. 
The common mutations found in the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, beta-glucocerebrosidase, earmark these proteins for destruction by the endoplasmic reticulum-localised protein folding machinery, resulting in enzyme insufficiency, lysosomal glycolipid storage and subsequent pathology. 
However, many of these mutants can be rescued from global misfolding to preserve glycolipid substrate binding and eventual catalysis in the lysosome, by the addition of subinhibitory concentrations of pharmacologically active small molecules. 
This novel, chaperon-mediated approach  has benefited from insights into the molecular understanding of beta-glucocerebrosidase structure, drug design and development in cellular models for disease. 
Imiglucerase and its use for the treatment of Gaucher's disease.  
BACKGROUND: Gaucher's disease is caused by deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity. 
Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase (Cerezyme, Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA), a recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, ameliorates systemic manifestations such as hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia and skeletal abnormalities in patients with type 1 (non-neuronopathic) and type 3 (chronic neuronopathic) Gaucher's disease. 
OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify and comment on the current issues related to imiglucerase for Gaucher's disease based on a review of published English language literature and personal clinical experience. 
RESULTS: The following topics were covered with respect to imiglucerase: development, pharmacokinetics, preparation and administration, efficacy, pediatrics, pregnancy, type 3 Gaucher's disease, dosing, treatment interruptions, safety and alternative pharmacological therapies. 
CONCLUSION: Imiglucerase is safe and well tolerated. 
In addition, it corrects the hepatic, splenic, hematologic and bone abnormalities observed with types 1 and 3  Gaucher's disease effectively and enhances health-related quality of life. 
Autosomal recessive mutations in the development of Parkinson's disease.  
Although Parkinson's disease was long considered a nongenetic disorder, it is now clear that there are multiple predisposing genes, and that the disorder can exhibit either Mendelian or non-Mendelian modes of inheritance. 
The identification of several of these genes has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of this common complex disorder. 
This article presents an overview of the genes associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, including Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ1 (PARK7) and ATP13A2 (PARK9). 
Recently, it was  recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. 
While Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, patients with Parkinson's disease can be Gaucher heterozygotes or homozygotes. 
Elucidating the basis for this association may shed light on new disease mechanisms that contribute to the development of parkinsonism. 
The neurobiology of glucocerebrosidase-associated parkinsonism: a positron emission tomography study of dopamine synthesis and regional cerebral blood flow.  
Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with  Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls. 
Patients with GBA mutations generally have an earlier onset of  Parkinson disease and more cognitive impairment than those without GBA mutations. 
We investigated whether GBA mutations alter the neurobiology of Parkinson disease, studying brain dopamine synthesis and resting regional cerebral blood flow in 107 subjects (38 women, 69 men). 
We measured dopamine synthesis with (18)F-fluorodopa positron emission tomography, and resting regional cerebral blood flow with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography in the wakeful, resting state in four study groups: (i) patients with Parkinson disease and Gaucher disease (n = 7, average age = 56.6 ± 9.2 years); (ii) patients with Parkinson disease without GBA mutations (n = 11, 62.1 ± 7.1 years); (iii) patients with Gaucher disease without parkinsonism, but with a family history of Parkinson disease (n = 14, 52.6 ± 12.4 years); and (iv) healthy GBA-mutation carriers with  a family history of Parkinson disease (n = 7, 50.1 ± 18 years). 
We compared each  study group with a matched control group. 
Data were analysed with region of interest and voxel-based methods. 
Disease duration and Parkinson disease functional and staging scores were similar in the two groups with parkinsonism, as was striatal dopamine synthesis: both had greatest loss in the caudal striatum (putamen Ki loss: 44 and 42%, respectively), with less reduction in the caudate (20 and 18% loss). 
However, the group with both Parkinson and Gaucher diseases showed decreased resting regional cerebral blood flow in the lateral parieto-occipital association cortex and precuneus bilaterally. 
Furthermore, two  subjects with Gaucher disease without parkinsonian manifestations showed diminished striatal dopamine. 
In conclusion, the pattern of dopamine loss in patients with both Parkinson and Gaucher disease was similar to sporadic Parkinson disease, indicating comparable damage in midbrain neurons. 
However, H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography studies indicated that these subjects have decreased resting activity in a pattern characteristic of diffuse Lewy body disease. 
These findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of GBA-associated parkinsonism. 
Structural features of membrane-bound glucocerebrosidase and α-synuclein probed by neutron reflectometry and fluorescence spectroscopy.  
Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are a common genetic risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease and related disorders, implicating the role of this lysosomal hydrolase in the disease etiology. 
A specific physical interaction exists between the Parkinson disease-related protein α-synuclein (α-syn) and GCase both in solution and on the lipid membrane, resulting in efficient enzyme inhibition. 
Here, neutron reflectometry was employed as a first direct structural characterization of GCase and α-syn·GCase complex on a sparsely-tethered lipid bilayer, revealing the orientation of the membrane-bound GCase. 
GCase binds to and partially inserts into the bilayer with its active site most likely lying just above the membrane-water interface. 
The interaction was further characterized by intrinsic  Trp fluorescence, circular dichroism, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. 
Both Trp fluorescence and neutron reflectometry results suggest a rearrangement of loops surrounding the catalytic site, where they extend into the hydrocarbon chain region of the outer leaflet. 
Taking advantage of contrasting neutron scattering length densities, the use of deuterated α-syn versus protiated GCase showed a large change in the membrane-bound structure of α-syn in the complex. 
We propose a model of α-syn·GCase on the membrane, providing structural insights into inhibition of GCase by α-syn. 
The interaction displaces GCase away from the  membrane, possibly impeding substrate access and perturbing the active site. 
GCase greatly alters membrane-bound α-syn, moving helical residues away from the  bilayer, which could impact the degradation of α-syn in the lysosome where these  two proteins interact. 
Analysis of human acid beta-glucosidase by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression.  
Structure/function relationships of acid beta-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, were evaluated by characterizing the proteins expressed from  cDNAs encoding normal and mutant enzymes. 
Twenty-two Gaucher disease mutations or created mutations were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and analyzed for catalytic properties, stability, inhibitor binding, and modifier interactions. 
Many Gaucher disease mutations encoded highly disruptive amino acid substitutions (e.g. 
P289L and D409V) and produced severely compromised proteins with very reduced activity (kcat < 1% of normal) and/or stability. 
Six mutant enzymes had sufficient catalytic activity (kcat approximately 5-30% of normal) for extensive studies. 
The highly conservative substitutions, i.e. 
F216Y or S364T and V394L, led to severe, but selective, abnormalities of enzyme stability or large decreases in catalytic activity, respectively. 
The T323I, N370S, and V394L  enzymes interacted abnormally with active site-directed inhibitors and localized  these residues to the glycon binding region. 
Selected mutant enzymes were poorly  activated by phosphatidylserine (V394L, L444P, and R463C) or by saposin C (L444P  and T323I), indicating that the enzyme sites for interaction with these activators were within the carboxyl one-third of the enzyme. 
Substitutions of Ser, Glu, and/or Gly at residues Asp-443 and/or Asp-445 demonstrated important steric roles for these residues in the active site, but neither is the catalytic  nucleophile. 
Together with previous studies, the present analyses provide an insight into the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and the functional organization  of acid beta-glucosidase. 
A novel alteration in metaxin 1, F202L, is associated with N370S in Gaucher disease.  
The gene for glucocerebrosidase ( GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease,  is located in a gene-rich region on 1q21. 
Metaxin 1( MTX1) is a convergently transcribed gene contiguous to the 3' end of the GBA pseudogene. 
A single nucleotide alteration in MTX1, 628T-->C, resulting in the amino acid change F202L, was identified in patients with Gaucher disease in association with the common N370S mutation in GBA. 
The polymorphism was also present on 4.6% of 152 control alleles, but could have functional consequences that have a modifying role in Gaucher disease. 
Spontaneous regression of disease manifestations can occur in type 1 Gaucher disease; results of a retrospective cohort study.  
Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. 
GD is classically divided into three major phenotypes. 
The most prevailing form is type 1, which presents with variable hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and/or bone disease. 
In adult patients with mild manifestations, progress of disease might be slow or even absent. 
As a  consequence, treatment with intravenous enzyme replacement or substrate reduction is not always necessary. 
In the Netherlands, the follow-up of GD patients is centralized, which allows detailed investigation of untreated patients. 
A retrospective study was conducted in 18 type 1 GD patients, (2 teenagers: 15 and  16 years of age at first visit) who were not treated for at least one year. 
The chitotriosidase activity, platelet count, hemoglobin level, lumbar bone marrow fat content measured with quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI), liver ratio (ml/kg body weight), and spleen volume were recorded. 
Criteria were developed to  score regression, stability or progression of disease. 
During a mean follow up of 4.5 years (range 1.1-12.2) seven patients (39%) showed spontaneous regression of  GD. 
Eight patients (44%) were stable. 
Two patients had progressive disease, solely based upon a sustained increase in chitotriosidase activity. 
A pediatric patient had an increase in splenomegaly but an improvement in bone marrow fat fraction, probably due to aging. 
Nine patients fulfilled the local criteria to start treatment at first visit, of whom six started treatment within 1.1 to 6.8 years. 
The other three refused therapy, but nevertheless showed stability or even regression of the disease during a follow up of 4.6, 9.5 and 11.4 years respectively. 
None of the parameters was predictive of progression or regression  of disease. 
In conclusion, GD in adults can, in some cases, regress spontaneously. 
No parameters for accurately predicting future disease course exist. 
Neurologic improvement in a type 3 Gaucher disease patient treated with imiglucerase/miglustat combination.  
PURPOSE: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. 
The neurologic manifestations of GD patients have to date been refractory to any treatment approach. 
We present a report of a neuronopathic GD patient whose myoclonic epilepsy improved after combination therapy with imiglucerase and miglustat. 
METHODS: In an adult type 3 GD patient who, despite good visceral and analytic response to ERT, developed progressive neurologic deterioration with marked myoclonic epilepsy and dystonia, we added miglustat to the enzyme-replacement therapy. 
RESULTS: After 2 years of combined miglustat (200 mg, 3 t.i.d.) and imiglucerase  (60 IU/kg every 2 weeks), generalized tonic-clonic seizures decreased, speech improved, and the general neurologic clinical picture improved markedly. 
The EEG  showed a reduction in focal and generalized paroxysmal discharges. 
No significant adverse effects were observed. 
CONCLUSIONS: Combined imiglucerase and miglustat therapy may be beneficial for some neuronopathic forms of GD. 
Gaucher's disease uncovered late.  
Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. 
This disease  is usually diagnosed in the first or second decade of life with the arising of bone pains, splenomegaly and hemorragic manifestations due to thrombocytopenia. 
When the enlarged spleen is not evident, or after splenectomy, patients may be mis-identified as having Gaucher's disease. 
We present here two cases of elderly  patients aged 70 and 46 years respectively, in whom the disease was a surprising  finding of bone marrow examination, during check up for pancytopenia. 
Alpha-synuclein interacts with Glucocerebrosidase providing a molecular link between Parkinson and Gaucher diseases.  
The presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn), particularly in its amyloid form, is widely recognized for its involvement in Parkinson disease (PD). 
Recent genetic studies reveal that mutations in the gene GBA are the most widespread genetic risk factor for parkinsonism identified to date. 
GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). 
In this work, we investigated the possibility of  a physical linkage between α-syn and GCase, examining both wild type and the GD-related N370S mutant enzyme. 
Using fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined that α-syn and GCase interact selectively under lysosomal solution conditions (pH 5.5) and mapped the interaction site to the α-syn C-terminal residues, 118-137. 
This α-syn-GCase complex does not form at pH  7.4 and is stabilized by electrostatics, with dissociation constants ranging from 1.2 to 22 μm in the presence of 25 to 100 mm NaCl. 
Intriguingly, the N370S mutant form of GCase has a reduced affinity for α-syn, as does the inhibitor conduritol-β-epoxide-bound enzyme. 
Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies verified this interaction in human tissue and neuronal cell culture, respectively. 
Although our data do not preclude protein-protein interactions in other cellular milieux, we suggest that the α-syn-GCase association is favored in the lysosome, and that this noncovalent interaction provides the groundwork to explore molecular mechanisms linking PD with mutant GBA alleles.

Large-scale screening of the Gaucher's disease-related glucocerebrosidase gene in Europeans with Parkinson's disease.  
Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the enzyme deficient in Gaucher's disease (GD) are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
To investigate the sequence variants, their association with PD and the related phenotypes in a large cohort of European, mostly French, patients and controls, we sequenced all exons of GBA in 786 PD patients from 525 unrelated multiplex families, 605 patients with apparently sporadic PD and 391 ethnically matched controls. 
GBA mutations were significantly more frequent (odds ratio=6.98, 95% confidence interval 2.54-19.21; P=0.00002) in the PD patients (76/1130=6.7%) than in controls (4/391=1.0%) and in patients with family histories of PD (8.4%) than  in isolated cases (5.3%). 
Twenty-eight different mutations were identified in patient and control groups, including seven novel variants. 
N370S and L444P accounted for 70% of all mutant alleles in the patient group. 
PD patients with GBA mutations more frequently had bradykinesia as the presenting symptom and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. 
The phenotype was similar in patients with one, two or complex GBA mutations, although the two patients with c.1263del+RecTL and N370S/RecΔ55 mutations had signs of GD. 
Segregation analyses in 21 multiplex families showed that 17% of the affected relatives did not carry GBA mutations found in the given family, indicating heterogeneity of the aetiology, but 46% of  the unaffected relatives were GBA mutation carriers. 
These genotype and clinical  analyses on the largest homogeneous sample of European patients studied to date confirmed that GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for PD, particularly in familial forms. 
Glucocerebrosidase mutations are not found in association with LRRK2 G2019S in subjects with parkinsonism.  
Alteration G2019S in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) has been identified in several populations of patients with parkinsonism, including Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with Parkinson disease. 
Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are also identified at an increased frequency among Parkinson probands, including those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. 
A Taqman Assay-by-Design SNP genotyping strategy was utilized to establish whether G2019S was found in association with GBA mutations. 
Among 37 subjects with parkinsonism who were heterozygous for a GBA mutation, none carried G2019S. 
Furthermore, G2019S was not found in 18 patients with Gaucher disease who developed parkinsonian manifestations and 11 other Gaucher probands with parkinsonism in a first degree relative. 
Among 45 patients with Gaucher disease without a history of parkinsonism, one G2019S carrier was found. 
These findings suggest that GBA and LRRK2 mutations are discrete risk factors for parkinsonism in both Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish subjects. 
French results of enzyme replacement therapy in Gaucher's disease.  
Gaucher disease is an inborn recessive autosomal disease due to a partial deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. 
The deficient activity leads to accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside in the liver, the spleen and bone marrow with concomitant anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
Patients with Gaucher disease have been classified in three types: type I is the more common, neurological manifestations occur in types II and III. 
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with modified placental human glucocerebrosidase (ceredase) or recombinant glucocerebrosidase (cerezyme) is effective in most type I Gaucher disease and has become the current standard care administered to thousand of patients worldwide. 
ERT has obviated the need for bone marrow transplantation and virtually eliminated the need for splenectomy. 
We report here the French study including adults and children. 
ERT of 30 to 60 U/K every two weeks as starting dose was administrated to 108 patients with severe type I Gaucher disease. 
ERT fully reverse many of the manifestations of the disease. 
ERT regimen alleviated fatigue, and hematological and visceral signs and symptoms in nearly all severely-ill patients. 
Skeletal responses to treatment develop much more slowly than hematological or visceral responses. 
Studies in pediatrics show that the disease is more severe in children. 
These children should be treated early in the course of their disease to avoid irreparable damage. 
Hematological manifestation  in type II cannot be reversed with enzyme replacement. 
In type III treatment can  rarely reverse neurological deficit. 
Gaucher disease is also an excellent candidate for gene therapy. 
Current development and usefulness of biomarkers for Gaucher disease follow up.  
Gaucher's disease is due to glucocerebrosidase deficiency which is responsible for the accumulation of non degraded glucosylceramide within the lysosomes of macrophages: these "Gaucher cells", overloaded and alternatively activated, release in patient's plasma numerous compounds (cytokines, chemokines, hydrolases...) some of which contribute to the various tissue damages. 
Some of these compounds are surrogate biomarkers which contribute to the evaluation of disease severity, progression and stabilisation or regression during treatment. 
To date, the most interesting biomarkers are chitotriosidase and the chemokine CCL18/PARC, especially in chitotriosidase deficient patients. 
These biomarkers together with the clinical evaluation help to therapeutic choice (treatment by enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy) and initiation decision, response follow-up and dose adjustments. 
Biomarkers should be assessed  every 12 months together with clinical evaluation in patients not receiving specific treatments. 
An assessment every 3 months is recommended during the first year of treatment. 
Then when clinical goals have been achieved, the frequency can be reduced to every 12 months if the therapeutic scheme is not modified. 
Alglucerase. A review of its therapeutic use in Gaucher's disease.  
Alglucerase is a mannose-terminated form of human placental glucocerebrosidase, developed to treat patients with Gaucher's disease. 
Functional glucocerebrosidase is deficient in Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder  that affects people of all ethnic backgrounds, but has a higher incidence among East European Jews (Ashkenazim). 
Gaucher's disease manifests with hepatosplenomegaly, bleeding disorders and bone disease, with the more rare subtypes (types 2 and 3) featuring neurological dysfunction. 
Prior to the development of enzyme replacement therapy, treatment for Gaucher's disease was mainly symptomatic relief. 
Primary treatment with glucocerebrosidase focuses on removal of the lipid metabolite that causes the pathology. 
Because of the rarity  of Gaucher's disease clinical trials are small, and much of the data investigating alglucerase therapy have been obtained from studies of patients with type 1 disease, the prevalent subtype. 
Nonetheless, after intravenous administration of alglucerase, improvements are evident within 6 months of therapy. 
Patients have increased haemoglobin levels and platelet counts, and decreased incidences of epistaxis and bruising. 
Spleen and liver size are reduced, and skeletal parameters improve. 
Children gain height and most patients  receiving alglucerase therapy are able to resume work and daily activities. 
Alglucerase is well tolerated, with few mild adverse reactions reported. 
Although the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information for alglucerase is limited, its unequivocal efficacy justifies enzyme replacement therapy with this compound  as first-line treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease, for whom treatment options are limited.

Lysosomal integral membrane protein-2: a new player in lysosome-related pathology.  
Lysosomes require the presence of many specialized proteins to facilitate their roles in cellular maintenance. 
One such protein that has proven to be an important player in the lysosomal field is lysosomal integral membrane protein-2  (LIMP-2), encoded by the gene SCARB2. 
LIMP-2 is required for the normal biogenesis and maintenance of lysosomes and endosomes and has been identified as  the specific receptor for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. 
Research into LIMP-2 and the SCARB2 gene indicate that it may be a factor contributing to the clinical heterogeneity seen among patients with Gaucher disease. 
Mutations in SCARB2 have also been identified as the cause of action myoclonus renal failure (AMRF), and in some cases progressive myoclonic epilepsy. 
A total of 14 disease-causing SCARB2 mutations have been identified to  date. 
The role of LIMP-2 in human pathology has expanded with its identification  as a component of the intercalated disk in cardiac muscle and as a receptor for specific enteroviruses, two unanticipated findings that reaffirm the myriad roles of lysosomal proteins. 
Studies into the full impact of LIMP-2 deficiency and the  LIMP2/glucocerebrosidase molecular pathway will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in Gaucher disease and AMRF, and to new insights into lysosomal processing, trafficking and function. 
A novel SCARB2 mutation in progressive myoclonus epilepsy indicated by reduced β-glucocerebrosidase activity.  
Action myoclonus renal failure (AMRF) syndrome is a rare form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy with renal dysfunction related to mutations in the SCARB2 gene. 
This gene is involved in lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate-independent trafficking of β-glucocerebrosidase (GC), an enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. 
We report a family with myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia and skeletal muscle atrophy but without cognitive impairment or overt renal disease. 
A novel SCARB2 mutation  was indicated by a striking discrepancy between lymphocyte and fibroblast GC activity in the proband evaluated for possible Gaucher disease. 
Our findings expand the genetic and phenotypic diversity of AMRF and suggest that low GC activity may present an important biochemical clue to the diagnosis of AMRF.

The role of saposin C in Gaucher disease.  
Saposin C is one of four homologous proteins derived from sequential cleavage of  the saposin precursor protein, prosaposin. 
It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. 
Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene that exhibits vast phenotypic heterogeneity, despite its designation as  a "simple" Mendelian disorder. 
The observed phenotypic variability has led to a search for disease modifiers that can alter the Gaucher phenotype. 
The PSAP gene  encoding saposin C is a prime candidate modifier for Gaucher disease. 
In humans,  saposin C deficiency due to mutations in PSAP results in a Gaucher-like phenotype, despite normal in vitro glucocerebrosidase activity. 
Saposin C deficiency has also been shown to modify phenotype in one mouse model of Gaucher  disease. 
The role of saposin C as an activator required for normal glucocerebrosidase function, and the consequences of saposin C deficiency are described, and are being explored as potential modifying factors in patients with Gaucher disease. 
Diurnal cortisol profile in Williams syndrome in novel and familiar settings.  
Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder associated with high rates of anxiety and social issues. 
We examined diurnal cortisol, a biomarker of the stress response, in adults with WS in novel and familiar settings, and compared these profiles to typically developing (TD) adults. 
WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. 
The cortisol awakening response in WS was associated with parent-reported levels of somatic complaints and social difficulties. 
Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile that may be sensitive to social and activity transitions throughout the day. 
Successful treatment of a morbidly obese and growth-retarded adolescent with Williams-Beuren Syndrome by combining the medication of growth hormone and sibutramine.  
A 16-year-old male adolescent diagnosed to have the Williams-Beuren syndrome was  referred to our obesity outpatient clinic, due to his morbid obesity (body mass index 39.2 kilograms per square metre) and gluttony. 
After several unsuccessful dietary treatments, we started therapy with sibutramine. 
As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with  a GH-treatment. 
This well-tolerated combination therapy led to a remarkable weight loss of 10 kg and a growth-rate acceleration of 3.7 cm/year. 
Nine months after stopping the treatment with sibutramine, a partial weight gain was noticed. 
This case report justifies further research work on a combination therapy with sibutramine and GH for similar cases. 
Growth hormone treatment in a child with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report.  
Growth retardation is a consistent finding in Williams-Beuren syndrome. 
The cause of short stature in this syndrome is unknown. 
Endocrine studies have failed to reveal abnormalities in the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis. 
We  report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.CONCLUSION: Although growth hormone deficiency is not likely to be a common cause of short stature in Williams-Beuren syndrome, we nevertheless recommend evaluation of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis in all cases. 
Growth hormone deficiency in a child with Williams-Beuren syndrome. The response  to growth hormone therapy.  
Pre- and postnatal growth retardation of unknown pathogenesis is a common clinical feature in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). 
However, growth hormone deficiency (GHD) has not been considered a major cause of growth retardation. 
There is only one patient in the literature with confirmed GHD who responded well to human growth hormone (hGH) therapy. 
We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy. 
Height SDS was -4.2 at the age of 12 months when hGH was initiated and increased to -0.8 at the age of 4.25 years. 
The pathogenesis of GHD in our patient is unclear. 
Nevertheless, the elevated levels  of prolactin and the response of hGH to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration are indicative of a hypothalamic rather than pituitary defect. 
In  conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height. 
Thyroid function and morphology in patients affected by Williams syndrome.  
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of abnormalities of thyroid function and morphology in a cohort of patients with Williams syndrome (WS). 
METHODS: Serum concentrations of free-T3, free-T4, TSH, thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOA) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgA), as well as ultrasonographic data, of 20 patients with WS (12 females and eight males), aged 1.7-34.9 years, were evaluated. 
RESULTS: Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. 
Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%). 
Thyroid antibodies were negative in all patients. 
Fourteen patients (70%) showed thyroid hypoplasia involving the  entire gland. 
In these patients, the left thyroid lobe appeared usually, but not  significantly, reduced compared with the right thyroid lobe. 
One patient (5%) showed thyroid hemiagenesis. 
Only five patients (25%) showed a thyroid with normal volume, and of these five, one patient showed marked thyroid hypoplasia of the left lobe. 
In all WS patients with diagnosis of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, thyroid hypoplasia was detected. 
No cases of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism were found in WS with normal thyroid volume. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function  in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. 
Patients with WS should be monitored for thyroid function and a thyroid ultrasound screening should be considered, especially in those patients with changes in thyroid function. 
Oxytocin and vasopressin are dysregulated in Williams Syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting social behavior.  
The molecular and neural mechanisms regulating human social-emotional behaviors are fundamentally important but largely unknown; unraveling these requires a genetic systems neuroscience analysis of human models. 
Williams Syndrome (WS), a  condition caused by deletion of ~28 genes, is associated with a gregarious personality, strong drive to approach strangers, difficult peer interactions, and attraction to music. 
WS provides a unique opportunity to identify endogenous human gene-behavior mechanisms. 
Social neuropeptides including oxytocin (OT) and  arginine vasopressin (AVP) regulate reproductive and social behaviors in mammals, and we reasoned that these might mediate the features of WS. 
Here we established  blood levels of OT and AVP in WS and controls at baseline, and at multiple timepoints following a positive emotional intervention (music), and a negative physical stressor (cold). 
We also related these levels to standardized indices of social behavior. 
Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS  versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. 
Further, in WS,  OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. 
In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. 
These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior. 
The data suggest a possible biological basis for amygdalar involvement, for increased anxiety, and for the paradox of increased approach but poor social relationships in WS. 
They also offer insight for translating genetic and neuroendocrine knowledge into treatments for disorders of social behavior. 
High prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults with Williams syndrome.  
A standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered to 28 adults with  Williams syndrome (WS). 
Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. 
Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects. 
HbA1c levels were not as reliable as the OGTT in diagnosing the presence of diabetes. 
Given the high prevalence of impaired glucose regulation, adults with WS should be screened for diabetes, and when present should be treated in accordance with standard medical practice. 
Hemizygosity for a gene mapping to the Williams syndrome chromosome region (WSCR) is likely the major factor responsible for the high frequency of diabetes in WS. 
Syntaxin-1A is a prime candidate gene based on its location in the WSCR, its role in insulin release, and the presence  of abnormal glucose metabolism in mouse models with aberrantly expressed Stx-1a. 
Thyroid anomalies in Williams syndrome: investigation of 95 patients.  
Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small  groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated  a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well. 
In our institution, we currently follow a  large population of WS patients who periodically undergo a multispecialist clinical evaluation that includes ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid gland, and levels of FT3, FT4, TSH, and anti-thyroid antibodies. 
Here, we report on the prevalence of thyroid structural and functional anomalies, in a population of 95  WS patients, half of them followed for more than 5 years. 
Our study confirms the  increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). 
Moreover, we demonstrated that TSH elevation declines with age. 
For this reason, we suggest that a complete thyroid evaluation be performed in every patient with WS, and that this medical complication should  be periodically searched for in follow-up visits. 
New case of thyroid dysgenesis and clinical signs of hypothyroidism in Williams syndrome.  
The authors report a female presenting with congenital heart defects, liver hemangiomas, and facial dysmorphisms admitted to hospital at 3 months of age because of feeding difficulties and poor growth. 
She had hypotonia and large tongue, "coarse" face, and umbilical hernia in presence of complex congenital cardiovascular malformations. 
In spite of normal neonatal screening we performed  serum levels of thyroid hormones. 
Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent. 
Thyroid scintigraphy with sodium 99m Tc pertechnetate showed a small ectopic thyroid located in sublingual position, so treatment with L-thyroxine 37.5 microg/24 hr was started with rapid improvement of the clinical picture. 
At 17 months of age the patient developed the complete characteristic phenotype of Williams syndrome  (WS); the clinical diagnosis was proven by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis which showed hemizygous deletion of the elastin gene on chromosome 7. 
Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS. 
Moreover, our case shows that clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may be present and the treatment may be necessary as it is in isolated congenital hypothyroidism. 
Exclusion of calcitonin as a candidate gene for the basic defect in a family with autosomal dominant supravalvular aortic stenosis.  
Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) may occur as an isolated autosomal dominant  trait or as a feature of Williams syndrome. 
It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome. 
We have excluded calcitonin as a candidate gene for SVAS using a gene specific probe. 
Thyroid morphology and subclinical hypothyroidism in children and adolescents with Williams syndrome.  
OBJECTIVE: To verify the prevalence of morpho-volumetric and functional thyroid abnormalities in young patients with Williams syndrome (WS). 
STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two patients with WS (49 boys and 43 girls, 0.2-17.2 years of age) underwent evaluation of thyroid function by means of thyroid-stimulating  hormone (TSH), fT3, and fT4 measurement. 
Thyroid ultrasonography was performed in 37 patients. 
Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were measured in all patients with abnormal thyroid function tests. 
RESULTS: None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. 
Thyroid antibodies were absent in all patients. 
The prevalence of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in the younger patients. 
Ultrasonography revealed morphological or volumetric abnormalities of the thyroid gland in 67.5% of patients; these abnormalities were more frequently observed in the older children. 
CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. 
The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function. 
Therefore, we suggest yearly monitoring of thyroid function and sonographic studies at least once in patients with WS. 
Treatment should be reserved for the patients with overt hypothyroidism or for those whose thyroid function shows signs of progressive deterioration. 
Characterization of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome.  
We have investigated the possibility of mutations in the calcitonin/calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) gene in children with Williams syndrome. 
Involvement  of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that  Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. 
To test the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible for the reduced calcitonin levels, we examined the calcitonin/CGRP gene structure in  Williams syndrome children. 
Analysis of white blood cell DNA by Southern blot hybridizations in 5 individuals did not show any detectable large deletions or rearrangements in the calcitonin/CGRP gene locus. 
The possibility of small deletions or point mutations within the exon encoding the mature calcitonin hormone is unlikely based on ribonuclease protection assays with patient DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. 
These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion. 
Imparied calcitonin secretion in patients with Williams syndrome.  
Thyroid hypoplasia as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism in Williams syndrome.  
In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance  are recommended. 
However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. 
In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. 
The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. 
Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). 
Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. 
Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. 
Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. 
Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life. 
Thyroid hemiagenesis and elevated thyrotropin levels in a child with Williams syndrome.  
A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. 
Thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy showed hemiagenesis of the left lobe and no evidence of ectopic tissue. 
TSH response to  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. 
The biological  activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity  (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. 
These abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. 
Thyroid function is not a recognized manifestation of WS and is not routinely investigated. 
However, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and thyroid dysgenesis have been found  in other WS cases. 
Genes mapping at 7q11.23, contiguous to the chromosomal region deleted in most WS patients, may be involved in the development of the thyroid gland, contributing to the complex phenotype of WS. 
Williams syndrome associated with chronic renal failure and various endocrinological abnormalities.  
A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  chromosomal analysis. 
The association of WS and chronic renal failure (CRF) is only rarely encountered. 
Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. 
Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted. 
While most of the endocrinological abnormalities observed in this patient could be attributed to altered endocrine circumstances in CRF, some findings stand in contrast. 
Furthermore, the testicular biopsy specimen showed severe hypospermatogenesis. 
Endocrine disorders observed in this patient may be at least in part, responsible for various clinical features underlying WS.

We assessed whether intermittent hypoxia, which emulates one of the hallmarks of  obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), leads to altered faecal microbiome in a murine model. 
In vivo partial pressure of oxygen was measured in colonic faeces during intermittent hypoxia in four anesthetised mice. 
10 mice were subjected to a pattern of chronic intermittent hypoxia (20 s at 5% O2 and 40 s at room air for 6 h·day(-1)) for 6 weeks and 10 mice served as normoxic controls. 
Faecal samples  were obtained and microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis by Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology. 
Intermittent hypoxia exposures translated into hypoxia/re-oxygenation patterns in the faeces proximal to the bowel epithelium (<200 μm). 
A significant  effect of intermittent hypoxia on global microbial community structure was found. 
Intermittent hypoxia increased the α-diversity (Shannon index, p<0.05) and induced a change in the gut microbiota (ANOSIM analysis of β-diversity, p<0.05). 
 Specifically, intermittent hypoxia-exposed mice showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a smaller abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla than controls. 
Faecal microbiota composition and diversity are altered as a result of  intermittent hypoxia realistically mimicking OSA, suggesting the possibility that physiological interplays between host and gut microbiota could be deregulated in  OSA.

Metagenomic analysis of the pygmy loris fecal microbiome reveals unique functional capacity related to metabolism of aromatic compounds.  
The animal gastrointestinal tract contains a complex community of microbes, whose composition ultimately reflects the co-evolution of microorganisms with their animal host. 
An analysis of 78,619 pyrosequencing reads generated from pygmy loris fecal DNA extracts was performed to help better understand the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the pygmy loris gut microbiome. 
The taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads indicated that pygmy loris fecal microbiomes were dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. 
The hierarchical clustering of several gastrointestinal metagenomes demonstrated the  similarities of the microbial community structures of pygmy loris and mouse gut systems despite their differences in functional capacity. 
The comparative analysis of function classification revealed that the metagenome of the pygmy loris was characterized by an overrepresentation of those sequences involved in aromatic compound metabolism compared with humans and other animals. 
The key enzymes related to the benzoate degradation pathway were identified based on the  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway assignment. 
These results would contribute to the limited body of primate metagenome studies and provide a framework for comparative metagenomic analysis between human and non-human primates, as well as a comparative understanding of the evolution of humans and their microbiome. 
However, future studies on the metagenome sequencing of pygmy loris and other prosimians regarding the effects of age, genetics, and environment on the composition and activity of the metagenomes are required. 
An efficient RNA extraction method for estimating gut microbial diversity by polymerase chain reaction.  
An extraction method was developed to recover high-quality RNA from rumen digesta and mouse feces for phylogenetic analysis of metabolically active members of the  gut microbial community. 
Four extraction methods were tested on different amounts of the same samples and compared for efficiency of recovery and purity of RNA. 
Trizol extraction after bead beating produced a higher quantity and quality of RNA than a similar method using phenol/chloroform. 
Dissociation solution produced a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in RNA recovery compared with phosphate-buffered saline during the dissociation of microorganisms from rumen digesta or fecal particles. 
 The identity of metabolically active bacteria in the samples was analyzed by sequencing 87 amplicons produced using bacteria-specific 16S rDNA primers, with cDNA synthesized from the extracted RNA as the template. 
Amplicons representing the major phyla encountered in the rumen (Firmicutes, 43.7%; Proteobacteria, 28.7%; Bacteroidetes, 25.3%; Spirochea, 1.1%, and Synergistes, 1.1%) were recovered, showing that development of the RNA extraction method enables RNA-based analysis of metabolically active bacterial groups from the rumen and other environments. 
Interestingly, in rumen samples, about 30% of the sequenced random 16S rRNA amplicons were related to the Proteobacteria, providing the first evidence that this group may have greater importance in rumen metabolism than previously attributed by DNA-based analysis. 
Techniques for reduction and posterior fixation through the anterior approach.  
Pelvic fractures, especially those of a Malgaigne type, frequently occur in patients who are polytraumatized. 
Sacroiliac disruption reflects a massive, disruptive energy force with concurrent soft tissue injury. 
Fixation through an anterior approach facilitates the accurate and stable fixation and avoids many soft tissue wound problems associated with open anterior approaches. 
The absolute indication for the approach is a posterior disruption of the sacroiliac joint with or without an iliac wing fracture that is unreducible by closed reduction techniques. 
Conservative treatment of Malgaigne fracture in young female--case report.  
INTRODUCTION: Pelvic ring injuries usually result from high-energy trauma, and cranial and abdominal multiple injuries are frequently present. 
Malgaigne fracture is referred to pelvic ring disruption at two sites, and is often treated surgically for its instability. 
We present a case of nonoperative treatment of Malgaigne pelvic fracture. 
CASE OUTLINE: A 17-year-old girl sustained a Malgaigne fracture falling off a horse. 
After ruling out urgent multiple trauma in local hospital, she was then transferred to Pediatric Orthopedic and Trauma Service at the Institute of Orthopedic Surgery "Banjica" Belgrade, with provisional cutaneous traction of 2 kg applied to her right leg. 
After the status evaluation, the supracondylar femoral traction was applied for three months, combined with pelvic cradle for first 73 days. 
Weight of traction was gradually adjusted according to x-ray check-up, ranging from 1-16 kg (1/4 of body weight). 
Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered for 10 days, and thromboprophylaxis for two months. 
After the removal of traction, physical therapy was applied and the patient achieved full weight bearing four months after the injury. 
Treatment outcome was a symmetric and stable pelvic ring, equal leg length, full range of motion in both hip joints and normal walking. 
CONCLUSION: Traction therapy, combined with gravitational suspension in pelvic cradle, resulted in excellent clinical result. 
Although significantly longer and  more loaded than usual, normal weight bearing and walking were promptly achieved  using intensive physical therapy. 
External fixation of unstable Malgaigne fractures: the comparative mechanical performance of a new configuration.  
An external fixator has been designed that is rigid enough to eliminate the need  for skeletal traction in patients with unstable pelvic-ring fractures. 
This Wichita frame is similar to the Pittsburgh frame but is stiffened by the use of locked crossbars connecting the side triangles. 
The frame was tested in cadaveric specimens by techniques previously reported. 
In addition, finite-element modeling of the various frame designs was performed to ensure that the frame configuration was optimal and to supplement in vitro test results. 
Multiple variables that can  influence frame failure loads were examined. 
Pathologic Malgaigne fracture following pelvic irradiation. A case report.  
Chiropractic care of a patient with low back pain associated with subluxations and a Malgaigne-type pelvic fracture.  
OBJECTIVE: To describe the chiropractic care of a patient with a pelvic ring fracture and concomitant subluxations of multiple segments of the spinal column. 
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 23-year-old male, after falling down a flight of stairs, was initially hospitalized for fractures of the pelvis. 
Five weeks posthospitalization, the patient initiated chiropractic care with complaints of severe low back pain with lower extremity involvement. 
He also complained of neck pain and occipital headache. 
The patient had several positive low back orthopedic tests with bilaterally absent Achilles deep tendon reflexes. 
The anteroposterior  radiographic view revealed ununited fractures at the left superior and inferior pubic ramus, noted as a type I Malgaigne fracture. 
Subluxations were detected at  the left innominate (ie, fracture-subluxation) and at the patient's lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine. 
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was cared for with contact-specific, high-velocity, low-amplitude adjustments to sites of vertebral and sacroiliac subluxations. 
The patient's response to care was positive, receiving great pain relief. 
Less than 3 months after initiating care, the patient returned to work on regular duty. 
CONCLUSION: There are indications that patients suffering from the injuries described above may derive benefits from chiropractic care. 
The practitioner must pay careful attention to issues of biomechanical and vascular stability and adjustment modifications in these types of patients. 
Pelvic fracture and associated urologic injuries.  
Successful management of patients with major pelvic injuries requires a team approach including orthopedic, urologic, and trauma surgeons. 
Each unstable pelvic disruption must be treated aggressively to minimize complications and maximize long-term functional outcome. 
Commonly associated urologic injuries include injuries of the urethra, corpora cavernosa (penis), bladder, and bladder  neck. 
Bladder injuries are usually extraperitoneal and result from shearing forces or direct laceration by a bone spicule. 
Posterior urethral injuries occur  more commonly with vertically applied forces, which typically create Malgaigne-type fractures. 
Common complications of urethral disruption are urethral stricture, incontinence, and impotence. 
Acute urethral injury management is controversial, although it appears that early primary realignment has promise  for minimizing the complications. 
Impotence after pelvic fracture is predominantly vascular in origin, not neurologic as once thought. 
Open reduction and internal fixation of an acetabular fracture during pregnancy.  
Fractures of the pelvis and acetabulum are common injuries in a mechanized society and frequently occur in the younger age groups. 
Commonly associated injuries such as hemorrhage, urethral tears, gastrointestinal injuries, and major vessel damage are well reported and well known to orthopaedic surgeons. 
Another less frequently reported complication of pelvic fractures is the potential association with pregnancy and subsequent childbirth. 
This problem was first described by Malgaigne in 1857 in his classic article on double vertical fractures of the pelvis, in which he described a 34-year-old woman with a pelvic  fracture who subsequently died during childbirth. 
A review of the literature reveals numerous articles addressing potential problems with parturition subsequent to a pelvic fracture and several articles dealing with pelvic fractures occurring during pregnancy. 
The current literature on pelvic fractures  during pregnancy, however, recommends only nonoperative treatment and, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of operative fixation during pregnancy. 
The purpose of this article is to report a case of an acetabular fracture in a pregnant woman treated with open reduction and internal fixation, who went on to  carry a full-term baby and have a normal delivery. 
Fractures of the sacrum and disk herniation: rare lesions in the pediatric surgical patient?  
Fractures of the sacrum and lesions of the intervertebral disks are seldom reported in childhood and adolescence. 
In our report, illustrated by three representative cases that we treated during the past six months, we show that sacrum fractures, not an easy diagnosis, may be more frequent than currently assumed, and that in quite a number of children and adolescents an anterior pelvic fracture may in fact be an unrecognized Malgaigne type pelvic fracture with a posterior fracture plane cutting through the sacrum. 
They may be accompanied by herniations and/or lacerations of intervertebral disks. 
CT detection of serious internal and skeletal injuries in patients with pelvic fractures.  
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of patients with known pelvic fractures who have additional findings of intraabdominal injury, as diagnosed at abdominal computed tomography (CT), and to determine if patients with specific types or patterns of fractures are more likely to have additional injuries. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 200 consecutive patients (125 women, 75 men; age range, 4-86 years) who had been admitted to a level 1 trauma center with osseous pelvic injury secondary to blunt trauma and who had undergone abdominal CT examinations. 
Abdominal CT findings in  these patients were classified as negative, positive, or minimal and correlated with mechanism of pelvic fracture. 
RESULTS: Sixty-five (32%) of the 200 patients had negative CT findings, 43 (22%)  had findings attributable to the trauma but required no follow-up, and 92 (46%) had positive findings that required nonsurgical management or exploratory laparotomy. 
Additional pelvic fractures were identified in 63 (32%) patients. 
The highest prevalence of additional injuries was in patients with Malgaigne fractures (four of 15, 27%) or bilateral pubic rami fractures (six of 18, 33%). 
CONCLUSION: CT examinations revealed that 135 (68%) of 200 patients with pelvic fractures secondary to blunt trauma had concomitant internal or skeletal injuries and that 92 (46%) patients had injuries severe enough to require nonsurgical management or exploratory laparotomy. 
Patients with bilateral pubic rami fractures or Malgaigne fractures were particularly prone to additional injuries;  therefore, abdominal CT examinations are recommended in these patients. 
Symptomatic enterothorax in right-sided dorsal rupture of the diaphragm.  
Traumatic avulsion of the right diaphragm from the lumbocostal arch is a very rare lesion. 
The authours report the case of a 27-year-old man who had suffered a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the right side, 10 years before. 
At the time of injury the lesion of the diaphragm went unnoticed. 
The diagnosis was made 10 years later when the patient was referred for chronic right thoracic pain combined with postprandial abdominal distension and crampy pain in the abdomen. 
The chest radiogram and CT-scan showed displacement of the right kidney and most of the right colon into the thorax due  to avulsion of the diaphragm from its dorsal insertion on the lumbocostal arch. 
Surgical repair was necessary to obtain relief from pain and to prevent intestinal obstruction. 
Reduction of the hernia, reinsertion of the diaphragm to  the lumbocostal arch and reinforcement of the repair with a prolene mesh prosthesis was performed through a right thoracophrenolumbotomy incision. 
Malgaigne pelvic ring injury in childhood.  
Pelvic girdle injuries leading to anterior and posterior disruption are rarely seen in children. 
External fixation is useful to reduce and stabilize the pelvis  in order to control massive blood loss due to severe venous bleeding. 
The anterior tension band element of the external fixator can successfully maintain reduction of the pelvic girdle. 
Dislocation or fracture dislocation of the sacroiliacal joint cannot be reduced with simple traction techniques. 
Leg length  discrepancy is to be expected when the hemipelvis is displaced. 
Seven cases of this rare injury in children are presented together with the late outcome. 
Treatment modalities are discussed. 
Avulsion Fracture and Myositis Ossificans in a Professional Teenage Dancer: A Case Report.  
Fractures of the transverse processes in the lumbar vertebrae occur as the result of major forces such as direct blunt trauma, violent lateral flexion-extension forces, avulsion of the psoas muscle, or Malgaigne fractures of the pelvis. 
Dancers make repeated and forceful hyperextension and flexions of the spine, which may cause fractures of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. 
Repeated trauma of muscles in dancers may cause avulsion fractures and myositis ossificans. 
Herein, we report MRI and CT findings of an avulsion from the right transverse process of the L2 and L3 vertebrae in a 16-year-old professional teenage dancer, who responded to conservative treatment. 
Stabilization of sacroiliac joint disruption with threaded compression rods.  
Eleven cases of sacroiliac dislocation and/or fracture (Malgaigne pattern) were successfully reduced and stabilized using two threaded compression rods. 
The mean follow-up period was 26.1 months (range, seven to 45 months). 
None of the implants failed and there was no subsequent displacement. 
Two patients had mild residual lower back pain, and one was treated with implant removal without subsequent relief of pain. 
One patient, in whom the operation was done 110 days after dislocation, had extension of an incomplete preoperative peroneal nerve palsy. 
After anterior pelvic ring stabilization has been performed, two threaded  3/16-inch diameter rods are driven from the normal posterior iliac wing superficial to the sacrum and through the reduced opposite iliac wing. 
Compression is obtained with washers and nuts. 
This procedure can be performed safely and effectively, providing stable fixation and allowing early mobilization to help lessen or prevent the complications associated with prolonged bed rest. 
Abdominal trauma associated with pelvic fracture.  
Comparative study of the Orthofix and Pittsburgh frames for external fixation of  unstable pelvic ring fractures.  
We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver  pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) fracture/dislocations. 
The pelves were quasi-statically loaded in longitudinal compression and loss of reduction (i.e., failure) was defined as 1.5 cm of diastasis at either of the fracture/dislocation sites. 
The Orthofix frame-pelvis  complex (four 6-mm half-pins) was comparable to the PTF-pelvis complex (eight 5-mm half-pins) in terms of load to failure and overall stiffness, but was 4-7 times stiffer at lower load levels. 
Both frame-and-pin complexes deformed moderately at the pin-bone interface, but, while the PTF also showed moderate displacement between frame components, the Orthofix had almost no frame intercomponent motion. 
Malgaigne's fracture: the Larrey variant--a case report.  
A rare Malgaigne fracture with caudal displacement of the acetabular section is presented. 
This variant has not received significant mention in existing literature. 
It is important because it changes the approach to initial stabilization. 
Treatment is best accomplished with ORIF and placement of a sacral bar. 
Significant complications would occur if this variant were mistaken and treated with traction. 
Surgical treatment of a Malgaigne fracture.  
Sacral fractures are generally accompanied by pelvic ring fractures. 
They rarely  develop in an isolated form. 
Sacroiliac dislocation without sacral fracture is extremely rare. 
We report a case with a sacroiliac dislocation without sacral fracture, which was treated surgically. 
Lumbopelvic stabilization was applied using iliac wing plates. 
The case was evaluated according to his clinical condition and visual analogue score (VAS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and Oswestry scales. 
Considering the role of the sacrum, which transmits the load of the entire spine to the pelvis, meticulous care must be given to ensure the mechanic stability of the spine when evaluating patients with sacral and pelvic fractures. 
Very serious spinopelvic instability is present in sacroiliac dislocations even in the absence of sacral fractures. 
Caudal migration of the sacrum together with the cranial migration of the iliac wings can cause serious pelvic imbalance and difficulties in walking and maintaining a standing position. 
Aggressive stabilization and fusion are required, and these must be performed in the early period. 
Posterior stabilization of pelvic fractures by use of threaded compression rods.  Case reports and mechanical testing.  
Unstable pelvic fracture with concomitant displacement of the uterus--case report.  
The paper deals with the displacement of the uterus observed during management of Malgaigne type pelvic fracture in a 33 years old female. 
An intrauterine device seen on the radiographs revealed displacement of the uterus towards contralateral side of the pelvis. 
The reduction of the fracture stabilized with Molski metal clamp reconstituted normal anatomy. 
Two compression rods to treat unstable lesions of the pelvic ring.  
The authors report 7 cases involving the surgical treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures (Malgaigne type) using two compression bars, as described by Tile. 
The method was used only in cases where x-ray examination and CT scan revealed that the posterior branch of the fracture was located at the very medial aspect of the sacrum (fracture through the sacral foramina or even medial to the sacral  foramina), and therefore could not be stabilized by using other devices. 
The pathological anatomy of Malgaigne fracture-dislocations of the pelvis.  
Caralluma Fimbriata Supplementation Improves the Appetite Behavior of Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome.  
BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from a deletion of the paternal genes in the region of chromosome 15q11-q13. 
PWS develops hyperphagia, which when left unmanaged, leads to an excessive ingestion of food. 
To date there is inadequate pharmacological treatment or supplementation for modification of the PWS hyperphagia and/or the associated behaviors. 
Therefore, the best practice is  familial supervision and restriction of diet and environment. 
AIM: We aimed to determine if the natural supplement of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) could attenuate hyperphagia or the associated appetite behaviors in children and adolescents with PWS over the 4-week pilot trial period. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial over a 10-week period to investigate the effects of CFE on hunger control, in a cohort of children and adolescents with confirmed PWS (n =15, mean age 9.27 ± 3.16 years, body weight 43.98 ± 23.99 kg). 
Participants from Australia and New Zealand ingested CFE or a placebo of maltodextrin/cabbage  leaf over a 4-week period, with a 2-week washout before the crossover to the other treatment. 
Weekly comparisons in appetite behavior, severity, and drive were recorded by parents, as scaled time-point measures on a hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS. 
RESULTS: CFE administration was found to induce a significant accumulative easing of hyperphagia (P = 0.05), with decreases evident in one-third of the participants. 
Furthermore due to CFE supplementation, a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) was recorded in the category of behavior and a decrease in hyperphagia (n = 8, P = 0.009) was observed at the highest dose 1,000 mg/day (recommended adult dose). 
There were no reported adverse effects at any dose. 
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that an extract of the Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata eases hyperphagic appetite behavior within a cohort of children and adolescents (n = 15) with PWS without notable adverse effects. 
The outcomes of this study will have a potential positive impact on PWS management. 
Localization of the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta 3 subunit to the Angelman/Prader-Willi region of human chromosome 15.  
Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). 
The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. 
However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. 
This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). 
No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. 
We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. 
Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. 
Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. 
The localization of this receptor  gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes. 
Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes share a common chromosome 15 deletion but differ in parental origin of the deletion.  
Many Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) patients have a cytogenetic deletion of 15q11q13. 
While AS and PWS share a similar cytogenetic anomaly, they have very different clinical phenotypes. 
DNAs from 4 AS patients were examined using 5 chromosome 15q11q13-specific cloned DNA segments. 
With the  present level of resolution, the molecular deletions between AS and those previously reported for PWS did not appear to differ. 
However, in contrast to the paternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 observed in the majority of PWS patients, maternal inheritance of the deleted chromosome 15 was demonstrated in the AS patients by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). 
Chromosome 15 uniparental disomy is not frequent in Angelman syndrome.  
Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). 
This hypothesis is derived from two lines of evidence. 
First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of  chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate  from different parental chromosomes. 
In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15. 
The second line of evidence comes from the deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. 
These patients have two maternal copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of one copy from each parent. 
By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 specific  DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. 
Inheritance of one maternal copy and one paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS phenotype in these patients. 
Maternal origin of 15q11-13 deletions in Angelman syndrome suggests a role for genomic imprinting.

Experimental approaches for investigation of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase phosphorylation.  
Phosphorylation of many aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs) has been recognized for decades, but the contribution of post-translational modification to their primary role in tRNA charging and decryption of genetic code remains unclear. 
In  contrast, phosphorylation is essential for performance of diverse noncanonical functions of AARSs unrelated to protein synthesis. 
Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) has been investigated extensively in our laboratory for more than a decade, and has served as an archetype for studies of  other AARSs. 
EPRS is a constituent of the IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that directs transcript-selective translational control in myeloid cells. 
Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of EPRS is essential for its release from the parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MSC),  for binding to other GAIT complex proteins, and for regulating the binding to target mRNAs. 
Importantly, phosphorylation is the common driving force for the context- and stimulus-dependent release, and non-canonical activity, of other AARSs residing in the MSC, for example, lysyl tRNA synthetase (KARS). 
Here, we describe the concepts and experimental methodologies we have used to investigate  the influence of phosphorylation on the structure and function of EPRS. 
We suggest that application of these approaches will help to identify new functional phosphorylation event(s) in other AARSs and elucidate their possible roles in noncanonical activities. 
Phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 dictates transcript-selective translational control.  
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical but essential member of the Cdk kinase family, and its dysregulation or deletion has been implicated in inflammation-related disorders by an undefined mechanism. 
Here we show that Cdk5  is an indispensable activator of the GAIT (IFN-γ-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a posttranscriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells. 
Through induction of its regulatory protein, Cdk5R1 (p35), IFN-γ activates Cdk5 to phosphorylate Ser(886)  in the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. 
Cdk5/p35 also induces, albeit indirectly via a distinct kinase, phosphorylation of Ser(999), the second essential event in GAIT  pathway activation. 
Diphosphorylated EPRS is released from its residence in the tRNA multisynthetase complex for immediate binding to NS1-associated protein and  subsequent binding to ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH. 
The mature heterotetrameric GAIT complex binds the 3' UTR GAIT element of VEGF-A and other target mRNAs and suppresses their translation in myeloid cells. 
Inhibition of Cdk5/p35 inhibits both EPRS phosphorylation events, prevents EPRS release from the tRNA multisynthetase complex, and blocks translational suppression of GAIT element-bearing mRNAs, resulting in increased expression of inflammatory proteins. 
Our study reveals a unique role of Cdk5/p35 in activation of the major  noncanonical function of EPRS, namely translational control of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. 
Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity.  
Glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) is a component of the heterotetrameric gamma-interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that binds 3'UTR GAIT elements in multiple interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible mRNAs and  suppresses their translation. 
Here, we elucidate the specific EPRS phosphorylation events that regulate GAIT-mediated gene silencing. 
IFN-gamma induces sequential phosphorylation of Ser(886) and Ser(999) in the noncatalytic linker connecting the synthetase cores. 
Phosphorylation of both sites is essential for EPRS release from the parent tRNA multisynthetase complex. 
Ser(886) phosphorylation is required for the interaction of NSAP1, which blocks EPRS binding to target mRNAs. 
The same phosphorylation event induces subsequent binding of ribosomal protein L13a and GAPDH and restores mRNA binding. 
Finally, Ser(999) phosphorylation directs the formation of a functional GAIT complex that  binds initiation factor eIF4G and represses translation. 
Thus, two-site phosphorylation provides structural and functional pliability to EPRS and choreographs the repertoire of activities that regulates inflammatory gene expression. 
Heterotrimeric GAIT complex drives transcript-selective translation inhibition in murine macrophages.  
The gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex in human myeloid cells is heterotetrameric, consisting of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 
The complex binds a structural  GAIT element in the 3' untranslated region of VEGF-A and other inflammation-related transcripts and inhibits their translation. 
EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999); L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK. 
Because profound differences in inflammatory responses between mice and humans are known, we investigated the GAIT system in mouse macrophages. 
The murine GAIT complex is heterotrimeric, lacking NSAP1. 
As in humans, IFN-γ activates the mouse macrophage GAIT system via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a. 
Murine L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade, but EPRS is phosphorylated only at Ser(999). 
Loss of EPRS Ser(886) phosphorylation prevents NSAP1 incorporation into the GAIT  complex. 
However, the triad of Ser(999)-phosphorylated EPRS, Ser(77)-phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH forms a functional GAIT complex that inhibits translation of GAIT target mRNAs. 
Thus, translational control by the heterotrimeric GAIT complex in mice exemplifies the distinctive species-specific  responses of myeloid cells to inflammatory stimuli.
